# Vending-Machine

This is the entire workflow that the vending machine implements righ now.

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)

### To run the test suite

First, you need to make sure you have [RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec/docs/gettingstarted) installed. As required above, once you have `ruby` installed, install `RSpec` is pretty straightforward. Just run the following command inside the root folder of the application:

```sh
$ gem install rspec
```

Once your have `RSpec` in your system, you only have to run the following command to run the test suite.

```sh
$ bundle exec rspec
```
